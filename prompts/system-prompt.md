This is an example system prompt, which is going to prime the LLM response for responding in a way that is close to the desired output.

For example, if this system prompt says to act like a pirate, any generated text to follow should sound like a pirate.

If the system prompt contains a ton of helpful information like who made the model, what it's name is, and when it's knowledge cutoff is, that will also help the LLM generate more accurate responses.

By using an intense system prompt when generating the chat dataset, you make sure that the responses to follow in this synthetic dataset are aligned with the behavior you expect from the fine-tuned LLM, without the need for so many tokens to be passed in via the prompt.
